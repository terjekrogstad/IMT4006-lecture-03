<h2>SOAP Limitations</h2>


<ul>
<li>Character-based protocol - Easy to handle, but may result in much text overhead for short </li>messages
<li class="fragment roll-in">Stateless protocol - Limits the possibility for bi- and multi-directional communication unless the system uses some kind of conversation identifier</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Limited support for enforcing security between peers / client-servers</li>
</ul>
